      <h1> Website Project</h1>
      <p>The website is created by Team 11(Team High Voltage). We made our website mostly with the help of HTML and CSS tools. While designing our website, we proceeded mainly in green and its tones and tried to provide a soft appearance. Our website consists of 3 pages under the headings of Home, Hour of Code, and Website project. More clearly, the home page has links to pages with brief information about each member of the team. When you visit the Hour of Code page, you can find the Facebook link with detailed information and photos of that day and the link to the Hour of Code official page. Finally, you can observe the personal code academy pages of the team members from the links just below the last page, which is the Website Project.</p>
