      <p> The Hour of Code event of us:

On the 15th of November, our team (team11) conducted an event dedicated to Hour of Code initiated by Code.org. The fundamental principle of Code.org is to teach basic programming skills by using distinguished and well-designed methods such as games, and puzzles as projects to beginner developers and child programmers. This unprecedented methodology of Code.org increases its value in the sphere of programming instructing sources. However, not every interested person, nor every child may be capable of understanding the concept of self-studying Code.org. at this point, the hour of code is an excellent helper for everyone both to improve and to practice their knowledge and skills. With the help of pre-structured "hours", those who already have profound knowledge and experience of working with Code.org can teach the ones who just got acquainted with programming. We, as a team, also benefited from this opportunity and chose a school (Secondary school number 5 of Xirdalan, Baku), and introduced Code.org to students. After describing we played games with them to show how they can reach a goal by using programming. They embraced the principles and functionality of Code.org with great joy and interest, they became keen on learning within minutes. We have great hopes that some of them will decide to establish their career in computer science. 
In conclusion, we appreciate the usefulness of Code.org and having a chance to work as a team and individually with this application. We would gladly participate in the spread of Code.org for everyone wishing to improve their skills in programming.
